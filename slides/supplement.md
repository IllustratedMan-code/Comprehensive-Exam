## Convolutional Layer

For each input value, a convolutional layer will apply a kernel matrix to the value and it's "surroundings", resulting in a single output value. Multiple kernel matrices can be learned by the layer, each attempting to identify a feature relationship. The area of a kernel matrix is known as a "receptive field".

## Topologically Associated Domains

Regions of chromatin that are isulated from each other. In other words,
chromatin within a TAD may interact with itself, but not with chromatin in other TADs.
